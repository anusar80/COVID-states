The zip file contains the data and the python code to recreate the estimates and graphs reported in "Behavioral Correlates of the COVID-19 Burdens in the States" on policytensor.com. 
The only thing you need to change is the path. I have "os.chdir('/Users/anusarfarooqui/Docs/Matlab/COVID')." You need to replace that path with the appropriate path on your local directory. 
Please let me know if you have any trouble replicating my results.
